Diffrax is inspired by previous differential equation libraries written for other frameworks. In particular:

- [torchdiffeq](https://github.com/rtqichen/torchdiffeq)
- [torchsde](https://github.com/google-research/torchsde)
- [torchcde](https://github.com/patrick-kidger/torchcde)
- [DifferentialEquations.jl](https://diffeq.sciml.ai)

Particular credit must go to DifferentialEquations.jl, which was invaluable as a reference implementation.

Thanks to the JAX team for the framework that makes this possible.
